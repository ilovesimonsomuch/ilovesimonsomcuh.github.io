YOU ARE SO PRECIOUS. When I see you I think about all of the things I could get, make, or say to you to give you joy. This picture reminds me of how much I feel SOOOO good when this happens. I think in this picture I got you a custard bun from the bakery I really like in Philly’s Chinatown and you just held it in such a precious way. I want to spend so much time just watching you be happy and just give you some of this happiness. Also I don’t know if you understand how much I love the way you hold and like handling things. This is not just me being  attracted to you, but genuinely there is such warm hearted-ness (idk if that is a word?), attentiveness, and just pureness in the way you do it. It reflects your heart and who you are as a kind and genuinely good person. I hope I get to experience you hold things, have joy, and give you joy for countless years to come.     </p>
