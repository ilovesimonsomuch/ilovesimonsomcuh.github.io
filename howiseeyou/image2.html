I remember so distinctly when you sent this photo to me because it was kind of soon after you had been away for a conference and valentine’s day had just passed. I was SUPER needy and I was craving to just see your face. I like this picture because not only do you look like the most precious person in the world, but I also just remember how distinctly I melted when I saw it. I see you as a sense of home and comfort. When you sent this I think it was to specify where you were in the library so I could see you. When I saw the picture I just felt like yayyy I can return back to home now! I don’t really know how to put it into words but when I see you, I see home. You make me feel so safe, seen, and just loved and being in your arms and in your heart is all I want.     </p>
