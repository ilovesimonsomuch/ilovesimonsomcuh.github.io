I don’t remember the exact context of this photo but I think it kind of captures something I feel like when I see you and am with you. Life is so fun and relaxing and thrilling and everything with you. I think because it is so wonderful, life is cruel and makes it feel like the time I spend with you goes by so quickly. Maybe this paired with being long-distance amplifies this feeling but either way sometimes things go by in a blur. Although this might be the case, I still feel like my best and most clear-headed self when I am   with you. Well…clear headed in some ways and VERY DISTRACTED and easily convinced in other ways. When I look at you I see and feel how you calm my mind, make it sharper, make me more eager, and just overall give me SO MUCH HAPPINESS. Also this picture reminds me of our casual conversations and chaos that occurs late in the evening. I love making you stay up at night to chat with me and I just love casually existing with you. When I see you, I feel like the world is at its most beautiful and I am my best self.     </p>
