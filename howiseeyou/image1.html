I think we are both very aware of how emotions often come with some sort of physical response. For example, when we are stressed about an exam or scared, maybe we’ll sweat. I’m not sure what the evolutionary or biological specific are about why this happens, but I’m glad it does. Although sweating profusely while stressed and having my heart race so many beats per seconds when giving exams, I’m happy I am able to physically feel how powerful your effect on me is. Let’s start with one thing that completely takes hold over me…your smile. When I see you smile, I experience something so humanly beautiful. The duality of life is super cool because I similarly feel my heart race and sometimes start to sweat when I see that I have made you smile. My heart becomes so full and I can’t even speak. All I can do when this happens is just stare at you and take in how lucky and fulfilled I am. I love you beyond measure Simon.
