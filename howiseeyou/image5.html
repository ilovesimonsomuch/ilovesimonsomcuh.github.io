This photo is quite packed for me. It was taken after I visited with you (with my parents) for the first time after graduation. After graduation was super scary and all I knew was that I loved you but I was scared about what was to come next. Although there are other scary things to come in the future (like grad school for you), this photo reminds me that being present and being so happy and grateful for the now is so so important. I get to stare into your eyes now and live life with you. I get to share the most random things that happen throughout my day. I get to be silly with you. I get to complain, rant, and show my evil side with you. I get to be so present with you and enjoy our time now. Being with you reminds me to breathe. It reminds me to live. All I need to do is look up and look into your eyes and all is well. I also think you are genuinely the most beautiful and handsome and just AHHHH person ever. You don’t even know the extent of my attraction to you (it is insane). Also this picture not only reminds me of being present and how attractive you are, but also reminds me of how much of the world reminds me of you. When I see something distinctively “Simon’s eyes blue" I think of you, whenever I see the stars I think of you (wink wink), whenever I see a lake I see you, whenever I see a humming bird I see you, and the list is just endless. I am excited to tell you about any and everything and just share my life with you. Your eyes and your existence make my heart ache in the most amazing and human may. There are no words to describe how much you mean to me.     </p>
